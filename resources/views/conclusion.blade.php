            <h2>Our Experience</h2>
            <p>Our experience with the frameworks that we chose has its ups and down. 
                For starters, it is a new thing for us to learn and adapt, 
                so it was very difficult and time consuming to install and configure each framework. 
                However, after playing with it for a couple days, we managed to understand the 
                general idea on the purpose of each framework. Overall, we would definitely use 
                these 2 frameworks again in the future, especially to build large project.

            <h2>Performance</h2>
            <p>Overall, the performance of these frameworks are amazing, although for small projects, 
                it is not recommended since it is too complex. But, it is definitely necessary to 
                use frameworks for larger projects.

            <h2>Installation Process</h2>
            <p>
                Installation-wise, it is definitely more complex than your normal html and css file, 
                especially for someone who have never used framework before.

            <h2>Creating Pages</h2>
            <p>
                So with Laravel, creating pages is easy, it's just adding new file as usual. 
                However, the difficult part is actually linking the page to each other. 
                For instance, to link the css file to your php file, you would have to go to 
                your terminal and input several commands. Linking a page to another also requires 
                extra step, but in my opinion, it is necessary in terms of building large websites 
                with hundreds of pages, since you can keep track of it easily and it is way more 
                organized.

            <h2>Learning Experience</h2>
            <p>
                Was the learning curve steep from your regular html/css project? 
                Absoulutely! Frameworks definitely give you a taste of building real 
                websites that most companies use. Although it is frustrating in the beginning, 
                but the more you go with it, the more you enjoy the experience.

            <h2>Looking Back at Framework Decision</h2>
            <p>
                We don't exactly regret, since we believe that other frameworks has a 
                similar process of adapting and installing. But what we got from 
                choosing Laravel and Tailwind is curiosity. We are curious on how other 
                frameworks work and definitely would want to try it in the future.
